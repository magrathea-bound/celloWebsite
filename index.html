                <div class="hidden">
                        <p>Along with her active recording and orchestral career, she has performed in many recitals all over the country, collaborating with other musicians for numerous events and performances. Along with holding a busy performance schedule, Dr. Kralik finds great joy in teaching. She enjoys working with the cello students of the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, as well as cello students in the surrounding area and from all over the world. Students of hers have successfully entered into other programs of study after graduating with their degree of study, with Dr. Kralik. Students have auditioned and been involved in various summer and academic string and music programs as well, receiving scholarships for their playing. In the summer of 2018, Dr. Kralik joined as faculty for the Tennessee’s Governor’s School for the Arts, where she works closely with students in cello master-classes and sectionals, and performs regularly with the other faculty in a chamber music series for the duration of Governor’s School. Dr. Kralik has taught cello at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan in the summers of 2017 to 2019.</p>
                        <p>In September of 2022, Dr. Kralik published an article in the American String Teachers Association Journal Vol. 73 No.3, 43 – 47, titled “Getting The Most Out of Recording Oneself: Learn to Incorporate Recording as Part of Good Practice Habits.” Since the publication of this article, Dr. Kralik has presented and held discussions on this topic in various venues. Most recently, in January of 2024, Dr. Kralik led a presentation for the Middle Tennessee State Band and Orchestra Association, a clinic for orchestra directors and educators in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. She presented for students, educators, and musicians at the All-West Region Clinic in Memphis, Tennessee of 2023, and the Lubbock Education Outreach Clinician for string orchestra teachers of Lubbock, Texas in June of 2022.</p>

                        <p>In her academic teaching, Dr. Kralik has enjoyed holding lecture courses on Music Theory, String Education for Music Majors, as well as Appreciation for Music, creating her own curriculum in these courses.  Dr. Kralik strives to be helpful to those that enter her classroom. As one learns to appreciate music in any of these courses, their heart grows, their minds expand, that through music they become more capable of being able to understand logic, to hear harmonies around the world and the joy of creation in collaboration with others in all of these endeavors. Music is powerful and can bring wholeness and greater understanding to a person when they can learn and grasp it.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Kralik performs on a German Wilhelm Hammig cello dated 1907 and an unnamed French cello bow thought to be from the Pierre Simon School circa 1880.</p>

                <h1>Halcyon for Violoncello and Piano</h1>
                <p>
Canadian composer Jocelyn Morlock (14 December 1969 – 27 March 2023), and music educator, she was based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Morlock's music displays an individual personal style, and experimental post-modernism, but is focused on emotion. Her musical language is typically tonal or modal but is expanded with extended techniques and coloristic effects. Halcyon is a work written for cello and piano, written for and commissioned by cellist Ian Hampton, for Canada Music week in 2003.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Johnston and Kralik enjoyed the expressive power of this work and the artful expression and depiction of the Halcyon, which is a bird native to Canada, living in woodland, and near streams. A Halcyon is a large bird with a substantial bill, a light blue upper body, with white underparts, and a blue breast.
